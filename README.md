# FOAF
## _About_
**[FOAF]** (an acronym of **friend of a friend**) is a machine-readable ontology describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects. Anyone can use FOAF to describe themselves. FOAF allows groups of people to describe social networks without the need for a centralised database. This allows software to process these descriptions, perhaps as part of an automated search engine, to discover information about you and the communities of which you're a member.

## _This repo_
In this repo is stored my personal FOAF profile created using [FOAF-a-Matic]. It was created as a part of a laboratory exercise of the Web Based Systems course at [FSCE in Skopje](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) that I was taking.
